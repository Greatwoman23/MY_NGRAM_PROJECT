# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
The challenge was to create a Makefile for an N-gram program

## Description
I solved the problem by creating a Makefile,a header file of my_ngram.h, an N_gram.c file when complied
Ngram file will open an N_gram.o file ,it also creates a ngram file when executed.

## Installation
I created a Makefile and it was executed using make

## Usage
N-Gram models work by taking a sequence of items, and predicting upcoming items.
 For example, imagine a string of letters used for DNA sequencing (i.e. GATC). An N-Gram model will analyze the sequence of letters and, utilizing training data, 
creates a probability distribution for the likelihood of upcoming values.
```
./my_project To run the project, you need to compile it first. You can use a C compiler like gcc to compile your program.

Here are the steps to compile and execute your my_ngram program:

Save your my_ngram program to a file with a .c extension, for example my_ngram.c.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved my_ngram.c.

Compile your program using the gcc compiler. Here's an example command to compile my_ngram.c:
This will create an executable file called my_ngram in the same directory.

Execute your program by running the my_ngram executable followed by one or more
for example ./my_ngram "Hello, world!" "This is a test."
This will run your my_ngram program and analyze the two input strings, printing the character counts to the console.
